Hi!
The goal of this project is to quantify frequency and likelyhood words such as "likely" and "rarely". The user will be presented with two words and be asked to select the more frequent / likely of the two.

Considering separating words into a few categories: quantities, probabilities, frequencies, etc.

I am building this with NextJS + Typescript + React + SQLite
Because I'm still in the early stages of learning all of the above technologies, ChatGPT helped by giving me a project outline, correcting my (very frequent) errors, and answering many a question (I've added summaries of these answers as comments)
